#Database not found
	If the program throws an error, that it could not find the database, check if the database has been correctly assigned to your system environment.
#Create a database
- 	Under Windows open the "Run..." dialog, either via startmenu or via windowskey + R and type in "odbccp32.cpl". Then execute the command.
- 	Now the ODBC-Datasource-Administration-Window should show up.
- 	Press the Add... Button in the User-DSN view.
- 	Choose the "Microsoft Access Driver (*.mdb)" and click Finish.
- 	Type in a datasourcename (please make sure it's the same as in the rbsjava.ini)
- 	Now under the tab database click the Create... Button and create the database in a location choosed by you.
- 	Confirm all "OK" Dialogs.
- 	You are done.
#No new data was found
- 	If the software finds no new data have a look into the specific file, either csv, or mdb and compare it with our local database manually.
	This error should only happen if there are no new records to be read from the file.
